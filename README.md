## About the Video Course
Deep learning influences key aspects of core sectors such as IT, finance, science, and many more. Problems arise when it comes to getting computational resources for your network. You need to have a powerful GPU and plenty of time to train a network for solving a real-world task. 
Dynamic neural networks help save training time on your networks. They also reduce the amount of computational resources required. In this course, you'll learn to combine various techniques into a common framework. Then you will use dynamic graph computations to reduce the time spent training a network. 
By the end, you'll be ready to use the power of PyTorch to easily train neural networks of varying complexities.
